This document provides instructions to install Rundeck Enterprise in an HA (cluster) configuration on AWS, taking advantage of ELB, RDS, and S3 for scale and availability.

## AWS Setup

This section describes the AWS environment setup needed before the Rundeck software can be installed.

### Key Pair

Create a key pair to access the Rundeck Enterprise EC2 instances, rundeckpro-ec2user. This key pair will be specified when it is time to launch the EC2 instances later on. This is also the key pair used to ssh to the EC2 instances.

- Open the Amazon EC2 console at: [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
- Go to navigation panel of the AWS console, under NETWORK & SECURITY, choose Key Pairs.
- Add the new key pair.

For further information, see [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair)

### IAM

Create a Role to allow the Rundeck EC2 and S3 plugins to access AWS API so we donâ€™t have to specify access and secret key strings.

- Go to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)
- In the navigation pane of the console, click Roles and then click Create New Role.
- Add the role name: rundeckpro-ec2-instance-role
- Attach the following policies: AmazonS3FullAccess, AmazonEc2ReadOnlyAccess

### Security Groups

Several security groups are defined to manage network access between the layers of the Enterprise environment (ELB->RUNDECK-RDS).

- Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).
- In the navigation pane, choose Security Groups.
- Choose Create Security Group.

Create the follow groups:

**sg:rundeck-elb**

inbound:

- type: http, protocol TCP, port: 80, source 0.0.0.0/0
- type: https, protocol TCP, port 443, source 0.0.0.0/0

outbound:

- type: all, protocol: all, port: all, destination 0.0.0.0/0

![](~@assets/img/aws-sg-elb.png)

**sg:rundeck-instances**

inbound:

- type: custom, protocol TCP, port: 4440, source sg:rundeck-elb
- type: custom, protocol SSH, port: 20, source sg:rundeck-elb

outbound:

- type: all, protocol: all, port: all, destination 0.0.0.0/0

**sg:rundeck-rds**

inbound:

- type: mysql, protocol TCP, port: 3306, source: sg-rundeck-instances

![](~@assets/img/aws-sg-rds.png)

### S3

Create a folder in the S3 bucket to store logs called rundeckpro. You will specify this folder name when the pro software is installed.

Go into the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3)

![](~@assets/img/aws-s3.png)

Set Policy:

![](~@assets/img/aws-s3-policy.png)

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::rundeckpro/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

For further information, see [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)

### RDS

Create an RDS mysql instance, rundeck-rds and place it in the rundeck-rds security group. Specify a database named "rundeck". Note the name of the RDS hostname because it is needed for the Enterprise installation.

- Go into the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds)
- In the top right corner of the AWS Management Console, select the region in which you want to create the DB instance.
- In the navigation pane, click Instances.
- Click Launch DB Instance to start the Launch DB Instance Wizard.

For further information, see [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateInstance.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateInstance.html)

### EC2

Create two EC2 instances for the Rundeck Enterprise cluster. Specify the following when launching the instance:

- Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
- From the console dashboard, choose Launch Instance.
- Select the AMI image: Amazon Linux AMI 2015.03.0 x86_64 HVM GP2

![](~@assets/img/aws-ec2.png)

- In the configure instance details, choose the IAM Role: rundeckpro-ec2-instance-role

![](~@assets/img/aws-ec2-iam.png)

- In the configure Security-group, choose the rundeck-instances

![](~@assets/img/aws-ec2-sg.png)

- Finally, add the key pair name: rundeckpro-ec2user

![](~@assets/img/aws-ec2-key.png)

### ELB

Create the ELB called rundeckpro-ha-elb. If you defined the HTTPS listener, you must create a new SSL certificate. You will upload the SSL cert and key when defining the HTTPS listener.

Kindly add which type of ELB ? Is it ALB or NLB ? Can it be mentioned regarding SSL termination and passthrough concept to considering special security requirement of E2E encryption ?

- Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).
- From the navigation bar, select a region for your load balancers. Be sure to select the same region that you selected for your EC2 instances.
- In the navigation pane, under LOAD BALANCING, click Load Balancers.
- Click Create Load Balancer.
- Define the listeners:
  - 80 (HTTP) forwarding to 4440 (HTTP)
  - 443 (HTTPS, required certificate: rundeckpro-cert) forwarding to 4440 (HTTP)

- Select the security group rundeck-elb

![](~@assets/img/aws-elb-sg.png)
